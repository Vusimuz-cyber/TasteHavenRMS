## Project Overview
TasteHavenRMS is an Android application developed in Java. It was originally built using Android Studio and designed to manage restaurant-related operations, including menus, orders, and basic reporting. Due to limited laptop storage and performance issues that caused frequent crashes, Android Studio was removed, and the project is now maintained and viewable in VS Code for code review and edits.  

> Please note that Android Studio is still required to build and run the application.
